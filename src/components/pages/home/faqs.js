            <div>
              Absolutely. We have a forever free{' '}
              <Link href='/docs/api/basics/endpoint'>endpoint</Link> you can
              use. It’s the best way to start using the service.
            </div>
            <div>
              The free plan runs under some limitation to avoid abusive usage of
              the platform, like burst rate, limited concurrency rate and daily
              rate limit.
            </div>
            <div>
              The free plan should be enough for little projects or low API
              quota.

              A pro plan has an API key associated, with configurable quota. You

              No problem, just start with the smallest pro plan, and at the
              moment you need more, you can upgrade your plan.
