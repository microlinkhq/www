Microlink API is exposed from two endpoints:

- **free** ([api.microlink.io](https://api.microlink.io)): The endpoint to be used for unauthenticated requests. It has daily rate limit.
- **pro** ([pro.microlink.io](https://pro.microlink.io)): The endpoint to be used for authenticated requests. It needs a previously register API key.

All you need to do for accessing any of these endpoints it to hit them using HTTP GET method, nothing else.

The endpoint accepts multiple query parameters. It doesn't matter if they are camel or snake case, both styles are supported.

/>

<Figcaption children='Provide the same API parameter but using snake_case has the same effect.' />

If you are using [Microlink Query Language](/docs/mql/getting-started/overview) (MQL), the endpoint is automatically determined in case you provide an API Key.
