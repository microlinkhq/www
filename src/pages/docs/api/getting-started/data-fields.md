  A human-readable representation of the author's name.

When a data field is media content, the following contextual data will be also returned:

  - `width`: file width in pixels.
  - `height`: file width in pixels.
  - `type`: file type extension.
  - `size`: file size in bytes.
  - `size_pretty` file size in a human readable format.

Moreover, if the media content is playable (such as [video](/docs/api/parameters/video) or [audio](/docs/api/parameters/audio)), the following fields will be added as well:

  - `duration`: source duration in seconds.
  - `duration_pretty` source duration in a human readable format.

You can customize this behavior via [meta](/docs/api/parameters/meta) and/or [data](/docs/api/parameters/data) in order to add specific data rules over the target URL.

Additionally, Microlink gives you some HTTP information over the target URL, such as:

  - `statusCode`: The HTTP status code associated with the url response.
  - `headers`: The HTTP response headers associated with the url response.
  - `redirects`: A collection of HTTP redirects, where each entry contains the status code and URL for redirects followed from the original URL.

The service also returns a `status` field to represent the stage of the current transaction. 

You can read [format](/docs/api/basics/format) section to know more about that.
