Microlink respects your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website <Link href='https://microlink.io' children='microlink.io' />, and other sites we own and operate, according to EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). See our [Data Processing Agreement](/dpa).

## Information we collect

**When you visit our website**: Our servers automatically log your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address anonymized, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other standard data provided by your web browser for website analytics purposes.

**When you choose a paid plan**: We ask for your email address and payment details, as well as what information you wish to include in your policy. This information is mandatory, as we use it to process the payment.

**When you consume our API**: Similar to data collected for website analytics purposes, we do the same in our API for detecting errors or improve response timing.

## Our legal bases for processing

We process information lawfully, fairly and transparently.

When you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this won’t affect any processing we’ve already done.

We retain information for our sales records and to facilitate additional support after your order is complete. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

While we retain this information, we’ll protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security.

At our discretion, we may update this policy to reflect current acceptable practices. We will take reasonable steps to let users know about significant changes via our website. Your continued use of this site after any changes to this policy will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around data and personal information.
