## Automating the web, for the web.

Microlink is created by [Kiko](https://kikobeats.com) as a side project in 2017 (7 years ago).

It started as a project for getting unified metadata from any URL. The project [metascraper](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper) was born.

We started to dig deeper and in order to get specific data from the HTML content behind any URL, it's necessary to have an accurate HTML markup. So we built [browserless](https://github.com/browserless/browserless), a browser automation library on top of puppeteer.

Getting unified metadata is great, but it's not enough. We needed to get specific data from the HTML content behind any URL. So we built [MQL](/docs/mql/getting-started/overview), a client library to get easy to define data rules.

All of this is running when you use [Microlink API](/docs/api/getting-started/overview), a service to automate any browser action.

## What we pursue

### Open source first

Microlink was born from open source — and we still build in public. Our libraries like metascraper, browserless, and MQL are all open, because shared knowledge drives better technology.

### The web is the platform

We don't reinvent the web — we embrace it. Everything we build starts from web standards: HTML, HTTP, browsers. If it works on the web, it works with Microlink.

### APIs as interfaces

Every capability should be accessible through a clear, predictable API. It’s how we turn complex browser automation into something anyone can use — simple, composable, and fast.

### Documentation is the product

A great API is only as good as its documentation. We treat docs as part of the product, not an afterthought — they should be readable, discoverable, and always in sync with the experience you get when you build with Microlink.
