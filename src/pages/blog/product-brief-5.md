### User Agent API Parameter

We added a new configurable [User Agent](/docs/api/parameters/headers) as API parameter.

Normally you don't need to specify this value but some websites can have a different output based on the incoming request user agent.

For example, is very common websites serve images on [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) format they detect that you are using Google Chrome.

### Video API Parameter

In the [previous](/blog/product-brief-3) Product Brief we introduced the first iteration of video support as part of the API supported data [types](/docs/api/getting-started/overview).

Although it's widely used when you consume the API response using our [SDK](/docs/sdk/getting-started/overview/), it can degrade the general user experience, making the response times a bit heavy, specially if you are only interested in the rest of data extracted by the API.

We decide leverage the decision in the new [video](/docs/api/parameters/video) API Parameter, when the default value is \`false\`.

If you are consuming link previews over the [SDK](/docs/sdk/getting-started/overview/), no breaking changes here. Otherwise, keep in mind you need to pass it to have the same effect as until now.

## Metascraper v3.11

[metascraper](https://metascraper.js.org) continues to improve, which makes our extraction engine more efficient.

Some significant changes since the last time have been:

- **Improved URL detection** using a [WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org) parser. Thanks [Stefan Andres Charsley](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/pull/82) for contribute ðŸŽ‰.
- **Optimized bootstrap process** loadind configuration file just [once](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/commit/cb18d36).
- **Speed up core rules** removing [non](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/commit/a36e240) [really](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/commit/296fda7) [necessaries](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/commit/47ec0e5) steps, also core is smaller and faster right now.
- **Add rules parameter support** doing possible load specific [rules](https://metascraper.js.org/#/?id=rules-1) out of the box.
- **Exported core validators** making possible [reuse](https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/pull/89) them and creating consistent third party rules set.

This changes has been deployed at [Microlink API](/docs/api), adding support for a new shiny functionality called **Custom Rules**: The ability to tell the API new rules to extract new data.

We are preparing a new post explaining how to do that, staty stunned ðŸ¤˜.
