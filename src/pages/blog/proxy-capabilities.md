title: 'Microlink Proxy: How it works'

All [Microlink Pro](#pricing) plans come with a built-in proxy layer that does automatic proxy resolution and rotation based on the input URL.

## What's wrong with URLs

The Internet is a wild place where every URL is different. That's an issue especially when you are doing things at scale.

When you are surfing the net and visit a website, there are situations you can't handle at all:

- The are geographic location restrictions (e.g., visiting a site from China).
- Your IP address is blacklisted (e.g., performing a request from a data center).
- You have to validate your identity (e.g., filling a CAPTCHA).

You can quickly face these problems when sending enough traffic to popular sites, like Instagram or Bloomberg, which, in turn, makes getting a successful response inconsistent.

## Resolving URLs gracefully

Wouldn't it be nice if every time you want to retrieve data from any URL, the Microlink API just returned the data all while handling any of the problems above transparently?

That's exactly what **Microlink Proxy** layer does. No failures. No maintenance. You don't need to do anything additional. It just worksâ„¢. 

The **Microlink Proxy** is enabled for all [Microlink Pro](/#pricing) plans and it will handle all the situations for the [Top 500](https://github.com/Kikobeats/top-sites) most popular worldwide websites, in a transparent way, by default.

Just for informational purposes, you can check if a specific request was resolved using the proxy layer by checking `x-fetch-mode` response header.

```bash
$ microlink https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/as-zenefits-stumbles-gusto-goes-head-on-by-selling-insurance

As you can see, the proxy layer respects other query parameters, such as [prerender](/docs/api/parameters/prerender) or [ttl](/docs/api/parameters/ttl).

Also, you can always provide your own [proxy](/docs/api/parameters/proxy).

Last but not least, **Microlink Proxy** is a **cross-feature**: it's available for all the Microlink products.
