# Text Formatting and Titleization

This project uses a specific approach to titleizing headings and captions to maintain consistency across the site.

## Titleization with `withTitle` HOC

Most headings, subheadings, and captions should be wrapped with the `withTitle` HOC (located in `src/helpers/hoc/with-title.js`).

### How it Works

The `withTitle` HOC automatically transforms the `children` of a component using the [microsoft-capitalize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsoft-capitalize) library.

### Core Rules

- **Capitalize the first word** of the sentence.
- **Use lowercase** for everything else (except for special words).
- **Special Words**: Centralized at `src/helpers/title.js`. These words (e.g., `Microlink`, `APIs`, `JavaScript`) always maintain their specific casing regardless of their position.

```javascript
import { withTitle } from 'helpers/hoc/with-title'
const Heading = withTitle(HeadingBase)

// Rendered as "The ultimate user-agents list"
// (assuming "user-agents" is not in special words)
<Heading>the ultimate user-agents list</Heading>
```

### Constraints

1. **String Children Only**: Automatic titleization ONLY works when `children` is a single string. If you pass an array of children (e.g., containing a `<br />`), titleization will be skipped.
2. **Title Prop**: The HOC does not look at the `title` prop; it only processes `children`.

### Manual Control

- **Disable Titleization**: Pass `titleize={false}` to skip the automatic transformation.
- **Exceptions**: Pass `omitTitleize={['word']}` to keep specific words from being capitalized.

## SEO and Meta Tags

For SEO-related components like `<Meta />`, do NOT rely on automatic titleization. Instead:

1. **Use Sentence Case**: Use sentence case (only the first letter of the first word is capitalized) for `title` and `description` props in `<Meta />`.
2. **Hyphenated Keywords**: Use lowercase for technical hyphenated terms like `user-agents` unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.

**Example:**
```javascript
<Meta
  title={`The ultimate user-agents list (${new Date().getFullYear()})`}
  description='Most common user-agents used on the Internet up to date'
/>
```

## Special Words

The titleization helper (`src/helpers/title.js`) maintains a list of special words that are always capitalized in a specific way (e.g., `Microlink`, `JavaScript`, `APIs`). Check this file if a word is being capitalized incorrectly.
