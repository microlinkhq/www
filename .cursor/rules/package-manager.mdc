# Package Manager

This project uses **pnpm** as its package manager.

- Never use `npm` or `yarn`.
- Use `pnpm` for installing dependencies, running scripts, and all other package management tasks.
- If you touch `package.json` scripts, keep them pnpm-friendly (avoid adding new `npm run` entries).
- Ensure that `pnpm-lock.yaml` is updated whenever dependencies change.
